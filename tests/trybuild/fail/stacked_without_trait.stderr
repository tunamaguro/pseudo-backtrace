error[E0599]: the method `as_dyn_stack_error` exists for struct `NotStacked`, but its trait bounds were not satisfied

   | ----------------- method `as_dyn_stack_error` not found for this struct because it doesn't satisfy `NotStacked: AsDynStackError<'_>` or `NotStacked: StackError`

   = note: the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
           `NotStacked: StackError`
           which is required by `NotStacked: AsDynStackError<'_>`
note: the trait `StackError` must be implemented
  --> src/lib.rs

   | pub trait StackError: core::error::Error {
   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   = help: items from traits can only be used if the trait is implemented and in scope
   = note: the following trait defines an item `as_dyn_stack_error`, perhaps you need to implement it:
           candidate #1: `AsDynStackError`
   = note: this error originates in the derive macro `StackError` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
